# **Saya Anak Malaysia Tesla Lightshow**

Hi we're Darryl and Imran. We made a Tesla lightshow to the tune of 'Saya Anak Malaysia'!

### Steps to Download & Play On Your Own Tesla:
1. Download the **fseq** and **mp3** file [here](tesla_xlights_show_folder/lightshow_Saya_Anak_Malaysia)
2. Prepare a USB flash drive according to this [guide](https://github.com/teslamotors/light-show#usb-flash-drive-requirements) and copy these two files into the drive:
     1. Create a base folder called "LightShow" (without quotation marks and case sensitive).
     2. Place the two files that you downloaded in (1) into the "LightShow" folder. They must be **renamed** "lightshow.mp3" and "lightshow.fseq"
     3. The drive must be formatted as exFAT, FAT 32 (for Windows), MS-DOS FAT (for Mac), ext3, or ext4. NTFS is currently not supported.
     4. The drive must **not contain** a base-level TeslaCam folder, any map update or firmware update files.
4. Plug the flash drive into your Tesla (ensure it's a USB port with data).
5. Open up Toybox on the menu, select Light Show and tap Schedule Show.
6. Select the **Custom USB Light Show** from the drop-down menu. Enjoy!
